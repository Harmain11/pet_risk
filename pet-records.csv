Upon returning to Cruces continued to experience vomiting without diarrhea. Anorexia noted for 8 days towards the end of July. Ascites observed. 5 years old and the only female among five dogs. Plays a significant role in the pack dynamics. Hematology revealed mildly elevated leukocytes. Liver function tests were within normal limits. CBC: Platelets 275 White Blood Cell count 12.07 Hematocrit 32% Total Protein 6.4. PT: 11 seconds APTT: 95 seconds (both within reference range). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of liver and spleen performed. Liver sample revealed granulated mast cells. Obtain a CBC and coagulation profile. Perform liver and spleen aspiration if coagulation profile is satisfactory. Consider core biopsy if indicated. Consult with an oncologist via Zoom for treatment planning. Potential treatments include Palladia omeprazole and diphenhydramine. Administer diphenhydramine injection (30 mg 0.6 cc IM). Initiate prednisone (5 mg 1.5 tablets twice daily).

19/12/2019,MN,Miniature American Shepherd,No,Raleigh has been having vestibular seizures. He has had 3 episodes - 11/21 2/9 and 4/22. They last less than 3 minutes and he returns to normal after. He mainly freezes up and gets nystagmus and off balance. He has had a full work up with a neurologist including an MRI and CSF tap. I am a GP veterinarian. Neurology suspects idiopathic as the cause and reports he will continue to live a normal happy life since these are short mild widely spaced events. Potential causes which have all been mainly ruled out include mini strokes hypertension cushings disease renal disease hypothyroidism brain tumor etc. Neurology recommended a cancer screen although very unlikely. He just had clear chest and abdomen radiographs and is having an abdominal ultrasound EEG and TEG performed on 5/13 with neurology. He is otherwise completely normal no other comorbidities (a little bit overweight) UTD on vaccines and prevention. He was on simparica trio but we switched to a seresto collar and interceptor because of the seizures. Neurology currently diagnosing this as “idiopathic vestibular epilepsy.” We have not started medication since the events are short and spaced out but a keppra trial is the next option.,0.025

The trachea and remainder of the visible mediastinal structures are normal. 5. The pleural space is unremarkable. 6. Multiple breed specific vertebral malformations are present within the thoracic spine 7. There is adequate intra-abdominal serosal detail. 8. The stomach contains a small quantity of heterogeneous soft tissue opaque ingesta and gas. 9. The small intestines are mildly gas distended and contain occasional soft tissue opaque content. There is no evidence of overdistension or intestinal plication. 10. The colon contains a small quantity of soft tissue opaque feces and gas. 11. The visible portions of the liver spleen urinary bladder and kidneys are normal. 12. In situ intervertebral disc mineralization is present at L6/L6. 13. Spondylosis is present at the lumbosacral junction. Conclusions: 1. Gastric and small intestinal ingesta DDX: Residual food versus non-obstructive foreign content. 2. L6/7 chronic intervertebral disc disease 3. Normal breed specific thorax Comments: The content within the stomach and small intestines is likely consistent with food however non-digestible foreign content cannot be excluded. There is no current evidence of a gastrointestinal mechanical obstruction. Continued supportive management could be considered and abdominal ultrasound (or alternatively repeat abdominal radiographs collimated to the abdomen only) performed should the patient fail to improve.,0.074
